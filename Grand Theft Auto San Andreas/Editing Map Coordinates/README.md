# REQUIREMENTS

- `3DS Max 2025`

- `KAMs Scripts`


# MAP STRUCTURE

- First, check if your map is using vanilla DFFs from the game
  - If so, use `IMG Factory` to export the DFFs from `gta3.img` and `gta_ing.img`
  - Open the IPL file of the map, and search the DFFs inside the imgs with the names provided by the IPL.

	The first 3 objects are custom, the others are vanilla. Parameters are:
	
	- `ID`: object identifier, IDs are registeres between a range (see ID ranges below)
	- `object name`: name that referres to the used DFF
	- `interior ID`: in which interior the object is used.
	- `XYZ Position`: 3D Vector which represents in game coordinates of map position
	- `XYZW Rotation`:  4D Vector which represents in game coordinates of map rotation
	- `LOD`: Level of detail to start from. -1 is `NO LOD` 1 is `USE LOD`
	

# IMPORT

- First of all, if your map is using vanilla objects, you need to add those strings to the `IDE` definitions.
  - Use `grepWin` to recurisvely search for the object name inside the IDE files.
  - Once found, add the object definitions to the map's `IDE` file and save it

- Open 3DS Max, on the `top-Right` you should see a section called `GTA Tools`

- Go to `Map > MAP IO`

- Change the `DFF Path` to the folder that contains your DFFs

- If the IPL contains coordinates in more sections than `INST`, then select the relative sections too.
  - You can check this by opening the IPL file with notepad++

- Select `Import IPL` and open the IPL of the map file to import.


# Editing Map Coordinates

- Select all the meshes with `CTRL+A`

- Click on the move icon, which is a cross composed of 4 arrows

- Click on the main mesh and you will get the current map coords in game.

- When you select all meshes, you can type inside the rectangular squares the coordinates for each axis


# EXPORT

- In `GTA Tools > MAP > Map IO` find the `kam ipl/ide Export` section

- Click on `import IDE`

- Click on `Export IPL`

- go to `Scripting > Scripting Listener` on the top-right

- Click on `Save As` and select as a filter `All Files`

- Manually write the IPL extension

- Now for the `IDE` file, click on `Export IDE` and repeat the process


# CLEANUP

- Delete the vanilla object definitions that you have added in the `.IDE` file.
  you don't need them anymore unless you have to edit the map again.
  
- Delete the vanilla `DFFs` placed in `gta3.img` folder of the map mod



# ID Ranges

- Single Player: `0 - 20000`, usable IDs start from 18632
- SA-MP: Free IDs range is `15065 - 15999`
