open the ERP file of one of the list below

replace these textures:

`boots_d/n/s`

`cap_d/n/s`

`glove_d/n/s`

`livery_d/n/s`

# EXTRA STEP

to get rid of the extra logos on the gloves, export the texture `"glove_logo_d"` and make it transparent, reimport and save.


NOTE: DO NOT REPLACE THE SUIT ON FOM01, CAUSES MIPMAP CONFLICTS IF YOU REPLACED THE HELMET FOR FOM01 AND MAKES ALL BLURRY.

# REPLACEABLE SUITS

-> SCHUMACHER01

-> SCHUMACHER02

-> SCHUMACHER03

-> SCHUMACHER04

-> SCHUMACHER05

-> SCHUMACHER06

-> 1990-SENNA

-> 1990-PROST

-> FOM01 (contains 70 years edition suit)

unlike the helmet you can replace multiple suits.


As for the drivers, the textures are duplicated in two files:

driver_name.erp
driver_name_helmet.erp

for each driver you will need to replace all the listed textures for both files.

ALso both contain the helmet textures so if you also want to change the helmet of the driver, you'll need to do the same.
