   `italiantext.bfl`

   `englishtext.bfl`

   `spanishtext.bfl`

   `germantext.bfl`


   where text strings are divided in these files (example with english files):

      `fenglish.txt`

      `genglish.txt`

      `senglish.txt`


 
 after editing the txt files with a simple notepad or whatever you use, replace the txt and again, 
 drag & drop the BWD file to create the new BFL to replace
